<p>A thorough rethink of how Citizens Advice could deliver better advice to people online involved a restructure, training and recruitment drive.  We went back to the drawing board to understand the role of digital advice alongside face to face and telephone services. Citizens Advice now has a world class content design team (<a href="https://wearecitizensadvice.org.uk/@simon.kaplan1">and leader</a>), offering help to over 18m people every year.</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service are working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hafsah-fitzgibbon-204512136/">Design and Explorations</a> at Good Things to create the UK’s first assisted digital service.  We also ran a 3 month pilot with the Home Office.  As more and more government services go online it’s crucial that people who don’t have digital skills have support to use them.  It makes sense that the UK’s biggest digital skills provider should take the opportunity teach as well assist people with their digital needs.</p>

<p>I lead Good Things Foundation’s work with NHS Digital to find new ways to embed digital inclusion in existing health services.  We’re running <a href="https://medium.com/nhs-widening-digital-participation/nhs-widening-digital-participation-our-new-pathfinders-oct-17-sep-18-5ad8191f2ce1">20 pilots</a> to look at how digital inclusion can work in <a href="https://medium.com/nhs-widening-digital-participation/social-prescribing-digital-skills-some-findings-3ca979d3973e">social prescribing</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/nhs-widening-digital-participation/the-trust-gap-digital-health-d226d4f31e7">young people’s mental health services</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/nhs-widening-digital-participation/pop-up-shop-co-design-designing-a-digital-health-hub-on-the-high-street-5c0cc8320e28">‘a pub without beer’</a>.  <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/peter-nuckley-b35426128/">This guy</a> makes it happen.</p>
