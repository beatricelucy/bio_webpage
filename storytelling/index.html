  <h1><a href="/">Hello. I’m Bea.</a></h1>
  <h2>Storytelling</h2>

<p>If a tree falls in a forest....I'm a storyteller at heart and have a good nose for news.</p>

<p>I built and ran Citizens Advice's award-winning news team and I've had stories on the front pages of every <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fit-to-work-benefits-test-unfit-for-purpose-10431154">major</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/npower-receives-10-times-many-3533982">tabloid</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/30/assisted-dying-inquiry-promises-fairness">broadsheet</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/38dbd827-fedc-3ebe-919f-e64cf55ea959">paper</a>.  I've ghost written comments for the FT, Telegraph and Observer newspapers and trained dozens of colleagues for appearances on the Today Programme, Newsnight and major news channels. I’ve appeared on Sky, BBC News and Woman’s Hour myself and done <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/718485/citizens-badvice/">crisis comms</a> too. Some of this has helped change government policy.</p>

<p>But there are many ways to tell stories and I also do this through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAMo7CT0uSk">talks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/beatricelucy">tweets</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@beatricelucy">blog posts</a>, conversations and pictures.</p>
