  <h1><a href="/">Hello. Iâ€™m Bea.</a></h1>

<p><a href="http://advicetracker.devops.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Advice Tracker</a> is a live barometer of the nationâ€™s problems. It presents live search data from citizensadvice.org.uk and Google. I hung it on huge TV at Citizens Advice HQ.  It helped us all remember why we went to work every day.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RTðŸ”’: petition to replace all right wing media with citizens advice live search stream <a href="https://t.co/bGE7yHAtyJ">https://t.co/bGE7yHAtyJ</a></p>&mdash; Huw Lemmey (@huwlemmey) <a href="https://twitter.com/huwlemmey/status/932990614064517121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p style="padding-top: 1em;">I hired a small product team to create <a href="https://wearecitizensadvice.org.uk/how-to-train-23-000-people-get-your-whole-organisation-involved-91d9a61c2065?mc_cid=f47fd78a97&mc_eid=9c124a618f">Casebook</a>, a national case management system used by 20,000 volunteers logging 6m cases every year. We were designing it to replace a heavily customised, slow and sticky off-the-shelf product. In its first 6 months, it saved 13 years of advisersâ€™ time - time theyâ€™re now free to spend helping people.</p>

<p>I think of this as product-led organisational change.  It involved getting buy-in from the executive team and board of trustees to offer the money and space to make it happen.  It meant retraining existing staff and hiring new ones.  It meant wrangling legacy IT systems and sensitive data.  And it meant asking people to trust us and to work with us to build something great. Itâ€™s change by doing.</p>

<p>And I got to work with some of the best <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismccormack/">product</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairpugh/">delivery</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalchottai/">UX</a> people out there.</p>
