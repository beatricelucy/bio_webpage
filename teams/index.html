  <h1><a href="/">Hello. I’m Bea.</a></h1>
  <h2>Teams</h2>

<p>An organisation is a prototype of the world we want to live in.</p>

<p>From building teams to major change programmes, I've led organisational redesigns from the inside, at <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/">Good Things Foundation</a>, and as a consultant for the public sector at <a href="https://www.tpximpact.com/weve-moved">FutureGov</a>.</p>

<p>I built and ran Citizens Advice’s award winning News Team, their Expert Advice Team, Content Team and Digital Product Team. This involved restructuring existing teams and all of the retraining, redeployment and options for redundancy that comes with that.</p>

<p>I formed the Design and Explorations Team at Good Things Foundation, a multidisciplinary team discovering new ways to tackle some of society’s most entrenched problems.</p>

<p>We did that by <a href="https://medium.com/design-like-you-mean-it/not-if-but-how-we-involve-people-a6484960b569">working closely with people and communities</a>. We never pretended to have the answers and we experimented with <a href="https://www.onlinecentresnetwork.org/community-challenge-prize">new ways to find the great stuff</a> that’s already happening out there in the real world.</p>

<p>We ran rigorous evaluation and experimental pilots. We worked with organisations like NHS Digital, to pilot 20 new ways to embed digital inclusion in existing health services and HMCTS, to design the government's first assisted digital programme. Our design practice focused on the relationships between people and we always designed with, not for people.</p>
