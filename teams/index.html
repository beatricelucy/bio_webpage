  <h1><a href="/">Hello. I’m Bea.</a></h1>
  <h2>Teams</h2>

<p>An organisation is a prototype of the world we want to live in.

<p>From building teams to major change programmes, I've led organisational redesigns from the inside, at <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/">Good Things Foundation</a>, and as a consultant for a range of different companies.</p>

<p>I built and ran Citizens Advice’s award winning News Team, their Expert Advice Team, Content Team and Digital Product Team.</p>

<p>I formed the Design and Explorations Team at Good Things Foundation. We run rigorous evaluation and experimental pilots.  We work with organisations like NHS Digital, to pilot 20 new ways to embed digital inclusion in existing health services and HMCTS, to design the government's first assisted digital programme.  Our design practice focuses the relationships between people and we always design with, not for people.</p>
